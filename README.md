# What is Timefreeze?

Timefreeze is a simple PKI-based trusted timestamping system written as student project in 2014. It allows generation of digital timestamp for any file and verification of existing timestamp. [NIST Randomness Beacon](http://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/nist_beacon.cfm) is used as reliable time source.
